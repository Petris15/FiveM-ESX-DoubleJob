## Description

[![][product-screenshot]](https://i.imgur.com/ZLcXlqu.png)

This script has been created especially for FiveM Roleplay servers. It allows you to have 2 jobs. That helps you make players have their legal and their illegal job at the same time. (The ESX version used is 1.1)

## Installation

1. Download this
2. Extract the ZIP file
3. Replace your previous `es_extended` with this one
4. Drag & Drop `esx_mafiasociety`
5. Import the `mafiajobs.sql` (You must have already the normal 1.1 sql data installed. This just adds what is important to make 2nd job working)
6. Start the `esx_mafiasociety` after es_extended but before your job scripts.
